A lot of the code is based on [NightsImageTool](https://github.com/mg35/NightsImageTool) which does not have a License.

Anything that is not directly based off of NightsImageTool, or NiGHTS into Dreams..., or Reloaded II, is probably by me, and falls under the [WTFPL-69.420](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sean-clayton/WTFPL-69.420/master/WTFPL-69.420.txt) license.
