A lot of the code is based on [NightsImageTool](https://github.com/mg35/NightsImageTool) which falls under the following license:

```
You are free to modify and distribute this tool as you see fit. Credit is appreciated but not required. The only restriction is commercial use. Please do not use this tool for commercial purposes.
```

Anything that is not directly based off of NightsImageTool, or NiGHTS into Dreams..., or Reloaded II, is probably by me, and falls under the [WTFPL-69.420](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sean-clayton/WTFPL-69.420/master/WTFPL-69.420.txt) license.
